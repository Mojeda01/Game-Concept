# Concepts & Ideas For Game Systems
- Crafting systems
  - **Resource Gathering**: Players collect raw materials from the environment.
  - **Blueprints/Recipes**: Players use blueprints or recipes to craft items.
  - **Skill Progression**: Crafting skills improve with practice, unlocking advanced items.
  - **Customization**: Allow players to customize crafted items with unique attributes.

- Trading systems
  - **Player-to-Player Trading**: Direct trading between players with negotiation mechanics.
  - **Marketplaces**: Centralized locations where players can buy and sell items.
  - **Auction Houses**: Players can bid on items, with the highest bid winning.
  - **Bartering**: Trade items without using currency, based on perceived value.

- Buying and selling
  - **NPC Shops**: Non-player characters sell items to players.
  - **Dynamic Pricing**: Prices fluctuate based on supply and demand.
  - **Special Deals**: Limited-time offers or discounts to incentivize purchases.
  - **Currency Systems**: Multiple currencies with different values and uses.

- Puzzles
  - **Environmental Puzzles**: Solve puzzles integrated into the game world (e.g., moving objects, activating switches).
  - **Logic Puzzles**: Require logical thinking and pattern recognition (e.g., Sudoku, riddles).
  - **Skill-based Puzzles**: Require player dexterity and timing (e.g., platforming challenges).
  - **Narrative Puzzles**: Advance the story through puzzle-solving (e.g., deciphering codes, finding clues).

- Prototypes of these puzzles/systems
  - **Mockups**: Create visual representations of the systems.
  - **Interactive Demos**: Build small, playable versions to test mechanics.
  - **User Testing**: Gather feedback from players to refine systems.
  - **Iterative Development**: Continuously improve prototypes based on feedback.

- Relevant algorithm suggestions
  - **Pathfinding Algorithms**: For NPC movement and navigation (e.g., A* algorithm).
  - **Procedural Generation**: Create dynamic content (e.g., dungeons, landscapes) using algorithms like Perlin noise.
  - **Economy Balancing**: Algorithms to balance in-game economy (e.g., supply and demand models).
  - **AI Behavior**: Implement AI for NPCs using state machines or behavior trees.
