# P2P Trading Concept

## 1. Define Basic Entities
- Player Class: Create a `Player` class with attributes like `name`, `id`, `inventory` (a collection of items), and currency (like gold or coins).
- Item Class: Define an `Item` class to represent the objects players can trade. Attributes could include `id`, `name`, `value` and `quantity`.

## 2. Implement Trading Logic
- **Trade Function:** Create a function that simulates a trade between two players. The function should take both players and their desired items as inputs. For simplicity, you can start with a barter system where players trade items directly or use a currency system where players can offer items in exchange for currency.

## 3. Simulate Trade Outcomes
- **Transaction Validation:** Add checks for successful trades, such as:
    - **Availability Check:** Ensure the player has enough of the desired item or currency.
    - **Value Balance:** If you implement a currency, ensure both players agree on the trade value.
    - **Trade Confirmation:** Simulate a confirmation mechanism where both players agree to the trade.

## 4. Simple User Interface
- **Command-Line Interface:** Use simple input/output statements to allow users to initiate trades. For example, ask the user to select a player, choose an item to trade, and specify the target player.

## 5. Logging and Feedback
- **Transaction Logs:** Create a simple logging mechanism to keep track of all trades and their outcomes. This can help visualize how trades evolve in your simulation.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Provide feedback after each trade, indicating whether the trade was successful or failed and why.

## 6. Simulate Multiple Trades
- **Randomized or Pre-Defined Scenarios:** Create scenarios where multiple trades happen between players. You can either randomize the trades or define specific sequences to simulate different trading dynamics.
