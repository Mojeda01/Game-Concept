# Textured Cube OpenGL Application

This program demonstrates basic 3D graphics programming using OpenGL. It generates and renders a textured cube in a 3D environment.

Key features:
- Dynamic cube geometry generation
- Texture loading and mapping (PNG format)
- OpenGL-based rendering with custom shaders
- 3D transformations and camera implementation

The application showcases:
- Vertex and fragment shader usage
- Texture coordinate generation and mapping
- OpenGL buffer objects (VBO, VAO) for efficient rendering
- Basic error handling and debugging for OpenGL operations
